# How to Use AI Features

<BookPageWrapper sectionId="ai-features/how-to-use">

This textbook includes AI-native features to enhance your learning experience:

## 1. 💬 AI Chat Assistant

Click the floating chat button (bottom right) to ask questions about the book.

### Two Modes

#### Mode 1: Search Entire Book
Just type your question:
- "What is ROS 2?"
- "How do I set up Isaac Sim?"
- "What's the difference between Gazebo and Unity?"

The AI searches the entire textbook and provides answers with sources.

#### Mode 2: Ask About Selected Text
1. Highlight any text on the page
2. The chat widget shows "Asking about selected text"
3. Type your question about that specific section

**Example:**
- Select: "Quality of Service (QoS) policies"
- Ask: "Can you explain this in simpler terms?"
- Get: Detailed explanation of the selected concept

### Tips for Best Results

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific: "How do I install ROS 2 on Ubuntu 22.04?"
- Reference sections: "In Module 3, what is cuOpt?"
- Ask follow-ups: "Can you explain that differently?"

❌ **Don't:**
- Ask about unrelated topics (AI only knows this textbook)
- Expect it to write full programs (use code snippets as starting points)
