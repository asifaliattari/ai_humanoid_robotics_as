# How to Use AI Features

<BookPageWrapper sectionId="ai-features/how-to-use">

This textbook includes three AI-native features to enhance your learning experience:

## 1. 🌐 Multi-Language Translation

Click any language button at the top of the page to translate the entire content:

- **English (EN)** - Original content
- **Urdu (اردو)** - Right-to-left support
- **French (Français)**
- **Arabic (العربية)** - Right-to-left support
- **German (Deutsch)**

### How It Works

- First translation takes 3-5 seconds (uses GPT-4)
- Subsequent views are instant (cached)
- Code blocks and technical terms remain untranslated
- Click "English" to return to original

**Try it now!** Click a language button above to see this page translated.

## 2. ⚙️ Content Personalization

Click the **"Personalize for Me"** button to adapt content based on your:

### Hardware Setup
- **No RTX GPU?** → See cloud alternatives (Colab, Paperspace, AWS)
- **No Jetson?** → Simulation-first workflow
- **Have Jetson?** → Optimization tips (TensorRT, nvpmodel)
- **No Robot?** → Simulation testing strategies

### Experience Level
- **ROS 2 Beginner?** → Prerequisites and basic tutorials
- **ROS 2 Expert?** → Research papers and advanced topics
- **ML Beginner?** → Simplified ML concepts
- **ML Expert?** → Optimization techniques

### Example Adaptations

If you indicated you have **no RTX GPU**, you'll see sections like:

> ### ☁️ Cloud GPU Alternative (For Your Setup)
>
> Since you don't have a local RTX GPU, consider these cloud options:
>
> | Service | GPU | Cost |
> |---------|-----|------|
> | Google Colab | T4 | Free |
> | Paperspace | RTX 4000+ | ~$0.50/hr |

**To enable personalization:**
1. Sign in (top right)
2. Complete your profile (hardware & experience)
3. Click "Personalize for Me" on any page

## 3. 💬 AI Chat Assistant

Click the floating chat button (bottom right) to ask questions about the book.

### Two Modes

#### Mode 1: Search Entire Book
Just type your question:
- "What is ROS 2?"
- "How do I set up Isaac Sim?"
- "What's the difference between Gazebo and Unity?"

The AI searches the entire textbook and provides answers with sources.

#### Mode 2: Ask About Selected Text
1. Highlight any text on the page
2. The chat widget shows "Asking about selected text"
3. Type your question about that specific section

**Example:**
- Select: "Quality of Service (QoS) policies"
- Ask: "Can you explain this in simpler terms?"
- Get: Detailed explanation of the selected concept

### Tips for Best Results

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific: "How do I install ROS 2 on Ubuntu 22.04?"
- Reference sections: "In Module 3, what is cuOpt?"
- Ask follow-ups: "Can you explain that differently?"

❌ **Don't:**
- Ask about unrelated topics (AI only knows this textbook)
- Expect it to write full programs (use code snippets as starting points)

## Privacy & Data

- **Translations**: Cached for faster loading (anonymous)
- **Personalization**: Requires account, stored securely
- **Chat History**: Optional logging for improving responses
- **Selected Text**: Never logged or stored

## Troubleshooting

### Translation Failed
- Check internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Some special characters may need manual review

### Personalization Not Working
- Make sure you're signed in
- Verify your profile is complete
- Check browser console for errors

### Chat Not Responding
- Verify backend API is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing and asking again

## Technical Details

All three features are powered by:

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (semantic search)
- **Database**: Neon Postgres (user data)
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- **Embeddings**: text-embedding-3-small

For developers interested in how this works, see [AI Features Documentation](/docs/ai-features/).
